## Introduction

NodeJS is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It is widely used for building fast and scalable network applications, such as web servers, APIs, and real-time applications. This repository serves as a collection of projects I've worked on while learning and mastering NodeJS, including building RESTful APIs, working with Express, integrating with databases, and more.
