# Summer Projects Repository

This repository showcases my learning journey and the projects I've worked on over the summer. Throughout this period, I have delved into a variety of technologies and tools, honing my skills across different programming languages, frameworks, and development environments. Here is an overview of what I've covered:

## Technologies and Tools

- **Web Development & Frameworks**
  - **Laravel**: A PHP framework to build robust web applications.
  - **NodeJS**: JavaScript runtime for server-side programming.
  - **APIs**: Design, development, and consumption of RESTful and GraphQL APIs.

- **Operating Systems & DevOps**
  - **Alma Linux**: A community-driven enterprise-grade Linux OS.
  - **NIX OS**: A declarative Linux distribution with unique package management.
  - **Azure DevOps - Pipelines**: CI/CD pipelines for automating deployment processes.

- **Machine Learning & Data Science**
  - **Python**: Basics to advanced concepts in Python, including sufficient knowledge to begin working on Machine Learning projects.
  - **MySQL & NoSQL (MongoDB)**: Database management, querying, and schema design.

- **Web Servers & Security**
  - **NGINX & Apache**: Web server configuration and optimization.
  - **SSL Encryption**: Implementation of secure communication using SSL certificates.

- **Containers & Virtualization**
  - **Docker**: Containerization for consistent development and deployment environments.

- **Project Management & Collaboration**
  - **MS Project**: Tools for project planning and tracking.
  - **Scrum Fundamentals**: Basics of Agile methodologies and Scrum practices.
  - **Git & GitHub**: Version control and collaborative development.

- **Programming & Software Design**
  - **Java8**: Building Java applications with modern features.
  - **C**: Foundational programming concepts and logic in C.
  - **PHP**: Backend web development with PHP.
  - **UX Design**: User experience design principles and tools.

- **Miscellaneous**
  - **Flowcharts & Diagrams**: Visual planning of project architectures and workflows.

### Python Script to Create Folders from `cursos.txt`

Here's a Python script that reads the `cursos.txt` file and creates the appropriate directory structure. It also ensures that similar technologies are grouped together based on a predefined dictionary of programming languages and their common frameworks.

```python
import os

# Dictionary mapping frameworks to their respective languages
framework_map = {
    'Laravel': 'php',
    'Symfony': 'php',
    'Django': 'python',
    'Flask': 'python',
    'Express': 'nodejs',
    'Spring': 'java',
    'Hibernate': 'java',
    'Angular': 'javascript',
    'React': 'javascript',
    'Vue': 'javascript',
    'Ruby on Rails': 'ruby',
    'Phoenix': 'elixir',
    'Asp.Net': 'csharp',
    'Symfony': 'php',
    'Zend': 'php',
    'Rails': 'ruby',
    # Add more frameworks and languages as needed
}

# Function to create directory structure
def create_directories(course_file):
    with open(course_file, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            course = line.strip()
            language = framework_map.get(course, course.lower())
            if not os.path.exists(language):
                os.makedirs(language)
            course_path = os.path.join(language, course.lower())
            if not os.path.exists(course_path):
                os.makedirs(course_path)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    create_directories('cursos.txt')
```

### How to Use the Script

1. **Create a `cursos.txt` file** in the root of your repository, listing all the courses as shown in your example.
  
2. **Run the script**:
   - On Windows: `python create_directories.py`
   - On Linux: `python3 create_directories.py`
  
   The script will create a directory structure based on the contents of `cursos.txt`, grouping frameworks with their respective languages.

3. **Customize**: You can expand the `framework_map` dictionary to include more frameworks and programming languages as needed.
